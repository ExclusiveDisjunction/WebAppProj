# Welcome to the 2023 Web App Project
**Group Members: Hollan S, Hannah F, Emilio D**

This is the work for our 2023 Web App Development project. 

## Using Git

To use git to update the information on the server & sync code changes, you must do the following steps:
    1. Commit changes on local computer
    2. Push changes to git by running `git push` in the current directory (assumes that you have git running on the current directory)
    3. Using the server's command line (either though SSH (described above)) or online, in the /var/www/html folder, run `git pull origin`.
    4. If you are viewing the website online, refresh the website.
